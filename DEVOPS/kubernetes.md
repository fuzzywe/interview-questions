## **Scaling**

### 1. **Horizontal vs. Vertical Scaling**
   - **Horizontal Scaling**: Adding more instances of a service to distribute the load (e.g., adding more pods in Kubernetes).  
   - **Vertical Scaling**: Increasing the resources (CPU, memory) of an existing instance (e.g., upgrading a VM).  
   - **When to Choose**:  
     - Use **horizontal scaling** for stateless services to handle increased traffic.  
     - Use **vertical scaling** for stateful services or when horizontal scaling is not feasible (e.g., due to licensing costs).

---

### 2. **Auto-Scaling in Kubernetes**
   - **How HPA Works**:  
     - Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) automatically adjusts the number of pod replicas based on metrics like CPU or memory usage.  
     - It queries the Metrics Server or custom metrics APIs to make scaling decisions.  
   - **Metrics**:  
     - Default: CPU and memory usage.  
     - Custom: Application-specific metrics (e.g., requests per second, queue length).

---

### 3. **Scaling Stateful vs. Stateless Services**
   - **Challenges with Stateful Services**:  
     - Stateful services (e.g., databases) require persistent storage and careful handling of data consistency.  
     - Scaling often involves replication, sharding, or partitioning.  
   - **Database Scaling**:  
     - Use **read replicas** for read-heavy workloads.  
     - Implement **sharding** to distribute data across multiple nodes.  

---

### 4. **Load Balancing**
   - **Even Distribution**:  
     - Use a **load balancer** (e.g., NGINX, AWS ALB) to distribute traffic evenly across instances.  
   - **Client-Side vs. Server-Side**:  
     - **Client-Side**: The client decides which instance to call (e.g., using a library like Ribbon).  
     - **Server-Side**: A central load balancer routes requests (e.g., Kubernetes Service).

---

### 5. **Scaling Databases**
   - **Strategies**:  
     - **Read Replicas**: Distribute read traffic across multiple replicas.  
     - **Sharding**: Split data into smaller chunks and distribute across nodes.  
   - **Sharding Benefits**:  
     - Improves performance by reducing the load on individual nodes.  
     - Enables horizontal scaling for databases.

## **Debugging**

### 1. **Debugging Microservices**
   - **Intermittent Failures**:  
     - Check logs for patterns or errors.  
     - Use **distributed tracing** to track requests across services.  
   - **Tools**:  
     - **Distributed Tracing**: Jaeger, Zipkin.  
     - **Log Aggregation**: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).

---

### 2. **Logging and Monitoring**
   - **Centralized Logging**:  
     - Use tools like ELK Stack or Fluentd to collect and analyze logs from all services.  
   - **Best Practices**:  
     - Use structured logging (e.g., JSON).  
     - Include correlation IDs to trace requests across services.

---

### 3. **Error Handling**
   - **Partial Failures**:  
     - Use **retries with exponential backoff** for transient errors.  
     - Implement **timeouts** to prevent cascading failures.  
   - **Circuit Breaker Pattern**:  
     - Stops making requests to a failing service temporarily to avoid overloading it (e.g., using Hystrix or Resilience4j).

---

### 4. **Performance Bottlenecks**
   - **Identify Bottlenecks**:  
     - Use monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to track CPU, memory, and network usage.  
   - **Tools**:  
     - **APM Tools**: New Relic, Datadog.  
     - **Profiling**: pprof for Go, JProfiler for Java.

---

### 5. **Distributed Tracing**
   - **What It Is**:  
     - Tracks requests as they flow through multiple services.  
   - **Implementation**:  
     - Use tools like Jaeger or Zipkin to instrument services and visualize request flows.

---

## **Managing Pods**

### 1. **Kubernetes Pod Lifecycle**
   - **Pod States**:  
     - Pending, Running, Succeeded, Failed, Unknown.  
   - **Troubleshooting Pending**:  
     - Check resource availability, node taints, or persistent volume claims.

---

### 2. **Resource Management**
   - **Requests and Limits**:  
     - Set in the pod spec (e.g., `requests.cpu`, `limits.memory`).  
   - **Exceeding Memory Limit**:  
     - The pod is terminated with an OOM (Out of Memory) error.

---

### 3. **Pod Scheduling**
   - **Scheduling Decisions**:  
     - Based on resource requests, node affinity, and taints/tolerations.  
   - **Taints and Tolerations**:  
     - Taints prevent pods from being scheduled on a node unless they have matching tolerations.

---

### 4. **Rolling Updates and Rollbacks**
   - **Rolling Update**:  
     - Gradually replaces old pods with new ones (e.g., `kubectl set image`).  
   - **Rollback**:  
     - Revert to a previous deployment version (e.g., `kubectl rollout undo`).

---

### 5. **Pod Networking**
   - **Pod Communication**:  
     - Pods communicate via their IP addresses and DNS names.  
   - **kube-proxy Role**:  
     - Manages network rules to enable communication between pods and services.

---

## **Network Mapping**

### 1. **Service Discovery**
   - **How It Works**:  
     - Services register themselves with a service registry (e.g., Consul, etcd).  
   - **Role of Tools**:  
     - Consul or etcd maintain a dynamic list of available services.

---

### 2. **API Gateway**
   - **Purpose**:  
     - Acts as a single entry point for all external requests.  
   - **Benefits**:  
     - Handles routing, authentication, and rate limiting.

---

### 3. **Network Policies**
   - **Enforcement**:  
     - Use Kubernetes Network Policies to control traffic between pods.  
   - **Benefits**:  
     - Improves security by restricting unauthorized communication.

---

### 4. **Service Mesh**
   - **What It Is**:  
     - A dedicated infrastructure layer for managing service-to-service communication.  
   - **Istio/Linkerd**:  
     - Provide traffic routing, security, and observability.

---

### 5. **DNS in Kubernetes**
   - **DNS Resolution**:  
     - Kubernetes assigns DNS names to services (e.g., `my-service.namespace.svc.cluster.local`).  
   - **Troubleshooting**:  
     - Check CoreDNS logs and ensure DNS configurations are correct.

---

## **System Design**

### 1. **Designing for Scalability**
   - **10x Traffic Spikes**:  
     - Use auto-scaling, load balancing, and caching.  
   - **CAP Theorem**:  
     - Choose two out of Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance based on use case.

---

### 2. **Data Consistency**
   - **Ensuring Consistency**:  
     - Use distributed transactions or eventual consistency.  
   - **Eventual Consistency**:  
     - Acceptable when real-time consistency is not critical (e.g., social media feeds).

---

### 3. **Event-Driven Architecture**
   - **Benefits**:  
     - Decouples services and improves scalability.  
   - **Challenges**:  
     - Requires robust message brokers and handling of duplicate messages.

---

### 4. **Caching Strategies**
   - **Implementation**:  
     - Use in-memory caches (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data.  
   - **Trade-offs**:  
     - In-memory caching is faster but limited by memory size.

---

### 5. **Security in Microservices**
   - **Secure Communication**:  
     - Use mutual TLS (mTLS) for service-to-service communication.  
   - **Authentication/Authorization**:  
     - Implement OAuth2 or JWT for secure access control.
